⏺ Weapons page looks good on mobile. The CSS fixes are working - nav buttons are
   full-width stacked, back link is styled as a button, auth is in flow. Let me 
  check the other subpages. Starting with the weapons table.

⏺ The weapons table has an issue - the right columns are being cut off. The     
  table needs horizontal scrolling on mobile. Let me check the other subpages   
  and then fix the table issue. Let me check the loadout builder.

❯ no, that's not an issue. that's by design. they fade out to indicate that

  scrolling. I'll check with you before assuming something is an error.
